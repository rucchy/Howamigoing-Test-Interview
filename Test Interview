# Node + React Interview

## Goal

You are going to build an anonymous online survey tool. Think: Google Forms.

## Terminology

The person who creates the survey will be called the *creator*.

The person who fills out the survey will be called the *respondent*.

## Requirements

You must use React, JavaScript (or TypeScript), and Node.js.

## User journey

A creator should be able to create a simple form with one or more questions.

A response to a question can either be a text field (300 characters max) or a five-point Likert scale (i.e. strongly agree to strongly disagree).

The creator can then give a URL to one or more respondents who can then fill out the survey.

When these respondents have filled out the survey, they can optionally enter their email address, and then click submit. The responses are saved in the database.

The creator can then see the answers for each of their surveys in a React-based frontend interface.

## Non-requirements

No login/signup system is necessary.

## Bootstrapping your project

You will need a backend and frontend. We suggest using `create-react-app` for the frontend, and choosing either Koa/Express for the backend.

## Timeframe

You should submit your solution within 7 days of receiving this assignment.

## Submitting your solution

Zip your git repository (including `.git` directory) and email your code to us.

After your submission, we will then setup a call with you to discuss your approach and understand how you thought through the problem.

## Bonus points

- ES6 syntax including arrow functions, destructuring and async/await.
- Types with Typescript.
- A spinner when content is loading.
- Handle errors coming from the backend.
- Unit tests.
- Integration tests.
- A nice UI using a components library (e.g. Ant Design, Bootstrap, etc.).
- Linter and code formatter.
- Well-formatted git commit messages.
- Dockerize.
- Deploy the project somewhere.
