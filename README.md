# Howamigoing Test Interview

Code written by Chema Ruano Fern√°ndez for Howamigoing.

## Description
This code is for the technical interview of Howamigoing. The objective is to develop a simple anonymous online survey tool like Google Forms.
Here is the complete description of the exercise: [https://hackmd.io/opKe7uyPSVmYuSTDb7hcrQ] (https://hackmd.io/opKe7uyPSVmYuSTDb7hcrQ).

There are two folder: one for the frontend and one for the backend.

## Requirements
  * NPM
  * TSC

## How to run
I used TypeScript for backend so before the `npm` you should use `tsc` to compile the files.
I used TypeOrm so only need to connect the database with the parameters in `ormconfig.json` in the howamigoing-test-interview-backend and when execute npm start, all the tables gonna be created.
